# OOADJ_Miniproject
An online examination system built using jsp and servlets.

The project includes three roles: 
Student role, Teacher role and Administrator Role.

Students can login after which they are directed to the examination screen where they must choose the exam they would like to take. 
Students can then appear for the exam and their scores are collected and updated in the database. The student can also view their exam score.

Once the student has completed the exam, the administrator or Teacher can login and view the marks of all the students that have appeared for the exam.

Teachers can set the paper for a particular subject and view questions that are already set before for respective subjects.

The Administrator can create new student and teacher accounts.

We are going to use Sessions for the examination module to accommodate features such as a timer, invalidating the session when the timer runs out
